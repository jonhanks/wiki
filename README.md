wiki
====

A simple Go  based wiki.  This is being done because each OS X upgrade breaks my moin moin install and to provide a test project for the Martini project.

Basic goals:

* Simple markup (initially markdown)
* Simple backend(s)
    * Flat file possibly as this is readable when the system dies
    * Sqlite
